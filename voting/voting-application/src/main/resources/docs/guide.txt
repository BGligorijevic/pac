This is a guide explaining how to run the voting application, independent from the target stage (development/test or production)

--Pre-requisites--
a) This archive is unpacked onto the desired location
b) NGinx is installed and configured according to the network and system architecture rules. NGinx is started.
c) MongoDB is installed and configured properly according to the network and system architecture rules. MongoDB is started.

--Running the application--
1. Copy the appropriate application.properties to "/back-end/config" folder.
The default file will already be there, please override it with appropriate stage configuration (D/Q/P system dependent).
2. cd to "/scripts" folder. Run appropriate script depending on the target OS (.bat for Windows or .sh for Unix-based OS).
This script will start the Tomcat, load appropriate configuration and enable remote debugger. Make sure the ports 80 and 8080 are available.
3. Copy the contents of "/front-end" folder to /usr/share/nginx/html (requires sudo) folder on Unix or {nginx installation folder}/html on Windows.
4. Go to localhost, the application should show up under http://localhost.
5. If "voting.dev.mode" is enabled, default users for the application are admin/admin, test/test and test2/test2 (username/password respectively).
