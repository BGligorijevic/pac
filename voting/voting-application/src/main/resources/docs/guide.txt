Running the voting application:

1. Make sure the vagrant is up. If not, run "vagrant up".
2. cd to /scripts of this archive. Run appropriate script (bat or sh).
This will start the Tomcat, load some testing data and enable remote debugger. Make sure the ports 80 and 8080 are available.
3. Install NGinx. On Unix it is started when installed, on Windows double click the nginx.exe to start it. Copy the contents of front-end folder to /usr/share/nginx/html (requires sudo) folder on Unix or {nginx installation folder}/html on Windows.
4. Start nginx web server.
5. Go to localhost, the application should show up under http://localhost.
6. Default users are admin/admin, test/test and test2/test2 (username/password). Enjoy ;)
